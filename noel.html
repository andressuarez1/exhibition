    <div class="box p">In humanities we created a collage portrait of our interviee. I chose images of places where the subjects parents are from, where he was married, and also who he worked for which was the Mexican government. I chose pictures of words that represent the values he was giving by his Mother and father. Also words like family and a picture of wedding rings because he got married and started a family. A picture of a gavel to represent the career in law he wanted to pursue. He went to school to become and engineer which is why theres a school and a picture with an engineer on it.

	<div class="box r">We also created an essay based on our interview. I took a quote that my interviewee said in the middle of the interview. I added quotes from website sources and cited them in mla format. I am proud i was able to use photoshop for the second time and come out with a final product i was happy with. For my essay i was proud of my topic and the body and message of my essay. A way i could improve on this project is I could get more feedback and make my essay longer.
